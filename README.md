# Climate-Data
it shows the data analysis and a report of climate change induced disasters in South Asia using the r-markdown.

The rmarkdown package is used to show the climate induced disasters impact in South Asia. 
The repository contains a R markdown file and a Data folder. This was a part of my SIS-750 Data Analysis course assignment taught by Prof Austin Hart. 

# Climate Change Data
The R markdown file climate_change.Rmd provides an insightful analysis of the social, economic, and political impacts of climate change on South Asian countries between 2010 and 2023. The report's focus is to investigate how climate change has affected the development of the region, which is home to over 1.8 billion people. To achieve this objective, the analysis is conducted using a four-step methodology that includes defining the scope of research, collecting data from reliable sources, analyzing the data, and drawing conclusions based on the findings.

The report utilizes the posterdown function of R to present its findings in an organized and easy-to-understand format. The study collects data from Emdat, which is a well-known and reliable source of information on climate-related events. The collected data is analyzed to provide an in-depth understanding of the effects of climate change on the region. The report's analysis includes a comprehensive overview of the region's vulnerability to climate change, the impact on human health, the economic implications, and the policy response of governments in the region. Overall, the study provides a valuable contribution to understanding the challenges posed by climate change and the efforts needed to mitigate its impact on the South Asian region.

# Purpose
The data used in the analysis is also available in the Data folder. The goal of the second R markdown file is to provide insights into the social, economic, and political landscape of South Asian countries, identify potential areas for improvement, and offer valuable insights to researchers and policymakers.

You can find the Emdat data from the following link;

# Final
These files aim to provide valuable insights into the development of South Asian countries regarding two crucial aspects: climate change and natural disasters.
